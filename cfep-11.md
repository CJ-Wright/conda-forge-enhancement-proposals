## Abstract

While we are still debating CFEP-06 (https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/9), we can 
implement a simple bot to close excessively old PRs on staged recipes. Our proposal is to use the GitHub stale bot to 
close PRs on staged-recipes that are more than 6 months old. The staged-recipes team is charged with both maintaining 
this bot and deciding on a nice and friendly message. 

As this CFEP is quite simple, we have omitted any other sections.
